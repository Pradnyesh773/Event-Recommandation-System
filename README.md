Event Recommender System with AI Chatbot
Project Description
This project integrates an Event Recommender System with an AI Chatbot to provide a seamless event discovery and interactive assistance experience. The recommender system suggests personalized events based on user preferences, while the chatbot, powered by Ollama AI, assists users in event queries through natural language interactions.

Features
âœ… Personalized Event Recommendations â€“ Uses machine learning to suggest events based on user preferences.
âœ… AI Chatbot with Ollama AI â€“ Chatbot answers user queries and provides event recommendations.
âœ… Location & Category-Based Suggestions â€“ Users can filter events based on location, category, or interests.
âœ… Interactive UI with Flask & Streamlit â€“ Web-based interfaces for easy interaction.
âœ… Event Images & Ratings â€“ Displays event details, including images, ratings, and attendee count.
âœ… Real-time Chat Responses â€“ The chatbot streams responses dynamically.
